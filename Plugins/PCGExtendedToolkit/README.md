![PCGEx](/Resources/Icon128.png)

# What is it?
### The PCG Extended Toolkit is a plugin for [Unreal engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) (5.3.x, 5.4) that contains a collection of **low-level PCG Graph elements** offering additional ways to manipulate and control PCG Data in unique ways. Its primary focus is to create spatial relationships between points, and build around them.

PCGEx allows you to create edge-based structures from points dataset, inside of which you can do pathfinding to generate splines; relax positions, attributes, flag specific types of connections, and much much more. 
It also comes with a set of lower-level, more generic features to manipulate attributes & points with a performance boost that can be up to 150x faster than some vanilla PCG Nodes; as well as highly granular parameters & tweaks.

### Thanks
- Kudo to [MikeC] for his reckless experiment with uncooked releases, feedbacks, suggestions. Without him this plugin wouldn't be as useful and stable as it is today.
- [@MaximeDup](https://github.com/MaximeDup) for making this properly compile on Mac
